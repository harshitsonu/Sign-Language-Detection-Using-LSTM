Real-time Sign Language Detection using Python and Deep Learning
This project is a real-time sign language detection system that uses a standard webcam to capture gestures and translates them into text. It leverages computer vision and deep learning to build a robust model capable of recognizing a set of customizable signs.

Features
1) Real-time Detection: Recognizes sign language gestures directly from a live webcam feed.

2) Customizable Gestures: Easily collect data and train the model to recognize new signs.

3) High Accuracy: Utilizes an LSTM deep learning model for high-precision sequence recognition.

4) Minimal Hardware: Runs smoothly on a standard computer with a webcam, no special hardware required.

5) Visual Feedback: Displays the detected sign and prediction confidence directly on the video feed.


Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Core Libraries:

  OpenCV: For capturing and rendering the webcam feed.

  MediaPipe: For real-time hand and body landmark detection.

  TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the LSTM neural network.

  NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

  Scikit-learn: For data splitting and model evaluation.
